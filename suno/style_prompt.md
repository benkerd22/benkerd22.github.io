Anime ED, bittersweet lyrical female vocal. Mid-tempo ballad ≈72 BPM. 
Arrange: sparse piano arpeggio + warm pad intro; brushed acoustic drums and soft kick enter v2; legato strings & gentle piano in pre-chorus; chorus opens with warm string swells, layered 3rd harmony backing, subtle synth pad for width. 
Vocal: close-mic, slightly breathy lead, 1–2 doubles in chorus (breathy double + cleaner octave). Minimal pitch correction. Reverb medium, plate on strings, subtle piano delay. Master warm, natural dynamics.
